        <h3><strong>Suez Canal</strong></h3>
        <p>
            The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea through the Isthmus of Suez and dividing Africa and Asia.
            In 1858, Ferdinand de Lesseps formed the Suez Canal Company for the express purpose of building the canal.
            Construction of the canal lasted from 1859 to 1869 and took place under the regional authority of the Ottoman Empire.
            The canal officially opened on 17 November 1869.
            It offers vessels a direct route between the North Atlantic and northern Indian oceans via the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans and reducing the journey distance from the Arabian Sea to London by approximately 8,900 kilometres (5,500 mi), or 10 days at 20knts to 8 days at 24knts.
            The canal extends from the northern terminus of Port Said to the southern terminus of Port Tewfik at the city of Suez.
            Its length is 193.30 km (120.11 mi) including its northern and southern access-channels.
            In 2020, more than 18,500 vessels traversed the canal (an average of 51.5 per day).
