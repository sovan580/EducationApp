        <h4>Nile River</h4>
        <p>
            The Nile is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa.
            The longest river in Africa, it has historically been considered the longest river in the world, though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.
            The Nile is about 6,650 km (4,130 mi)[n 1] long and its drainage basin covers eleven countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt.
            In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan.
